Notes:
My approach was based on the criteria as stated in the brief :
Code structure – Proper separation of concerns (Controller, Service, Repository, and DTO).
Efficiency – Using JPA instead of JDBC template for database interactions.
Maintainability and flexibility – Using dependency injection, service layers, and creating reusable components, Added Swagger for documentation and this also adds to testing. Also added versioning for the api to maintain.
Testability – Creating service classes for easier unit testing.
Fault tolerance and error handling – Proper exception handling and using retries if needed.
Observability and auditability – Implementing logging for better traceability.
Dependency management – Using Spring Boot's dependency injection.
Portability and interoperability – Using standard libraries and Spring Boot convention
Security and Maintianability - Moved sns config and other possible application config into the properties file and referenced as a environment variable where needed.
Just a few extra points to mention:

I did create the classes for the aws sdk as you would see .
I do understand that if we did import that library that I would not need those publishRequest, publishResponse and SNSClientService classes. 
I also mocked the Account entity and the fields to add the repository interface .
I also added lombok to the application to remove any boilerplate code . This could be done in a later version of Java using record but I did use lombok in this instance.
I also created a enum for the withrawalEvent status just as a more efficient way of having set statuses and managing those concrete responses.
